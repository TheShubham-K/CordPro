    Nikola Tesla Born 10 July 1856 â€“ 7 January 1943 was a Serbian-American
    inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist who is
    best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating
    current (AC) electricity supply system.[7] Born and raised in the Austrian
    Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without
    receiving a degree, and gained practical experience in the early 1880s
    working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power
    industry. He emigrated in 1884 to the United States, where he became a
    naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine
    Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of
    partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and
    companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical
    devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related
    polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned
    him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the
    polyphase system which that company eventually marketed. Attempting to
    develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of
    experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge
    tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat,
    one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor
    and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at
    his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout
    the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide
    wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency
    power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made
    pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his
    devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished
    Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and
    power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.[8]
